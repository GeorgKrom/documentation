# Usage with Next.js

It's possible to implement FSD in a Next.js project, but conflicts arise due to differences between Next.js project structure requirements and FSD principles.

## Conflict between FSD and Next.js in the `app` layer

Next.js suggests using the `app` folder to define application routes. Next.js expects files in the `app` folder to correspond to URLs.
This routing mechanism **does not align** with the FSD concept, as it's not possible to maintain a flat slice structure with such a routing mechanism.

The approach is to move the Next.js `app` folder to the project root and import FSD pages into the Next.js `app` folder.
This preserves the FSD project structure inside the `src` folder.

You should also add a `pages` folder to the project root because App Router is compatible with Pages Router.
The best way is to put an empty `.gitkeep` or `README.md` file inside describing the need to save this folder.

```sh
├── app              # App folder (Next.js)
├── pages            # Legacy pages folder (Next.js)
│   └── .gitkeep     # To maintain compatibility with Pages Router
└── src
    ├── app
    ├── pages
    ├── widgets
    ├── features
    ├── entities
    └── shared
```

### Example of re-exporting a page from `src/pages/example` to `app/example/page.tsx`

```tsx title="app/example/page.tsx"
export { Example as default, metadata } from '@/pages/example';
```

### Middleware
If you use middleware in your project, it must be located in the project root alongside the `app` and `pages` folders.

### Instrumentation
The `instrumentation.ts|js` file allows you to monitor the performance and behavior of your application. If you use it, it must be located in the project root, similar to `middleware.ts|js`.

### Route Handlers
It is suggested to use a new `routes` segment in the `app` or `pages` layer to work with Route Handlers.

```tsx title="app/api/get-example/route.ts"
export { getExample as GET } from '@/pages/example';
```

### Additional recommendations
- Use the `queries` segment in the `shared` layer to describe database queries and their further use in higher layers.
- Caching and revalidating queries logic is better kept in the same place as the queries themselves, in a basic scenario this is the `api` segment in the `shared` layer.

## Legacy approach with Pages Router

In Next.js below version 13, there is no explicit `app` folder. Next.js provides a `_app.tsx` file instead, which serves as a wrapper component for all project pages.

### Importing functionality into `pages/_app.tsx`

To solve the problem of missing the `app` folder in the Next.js structure, you can create an `App` component inside the `app` layer and import it into `pages/_app.tsx` so that Next.js can work with it.
For example:

```tsx title="app/providers/index.tsx"
const App = ({ Component, pageProps }: IProps) => {
  return (
    <Provider1>
      <Provider2>
        <BaseLayout>
            <Component { ...pageProps } />
        </BaseLayout>
      </Provider2>
    </Provider1>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Then you can import the `App` component and global project styles into `pages/_app.tsx` as follows:

```tsx title="pages/_app.tsx"
import 'app/styles/globals.css'

export { default } from 'app/providers';
```
